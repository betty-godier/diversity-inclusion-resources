An ever growing and pseudo-organized list of articles, blogs, videos, tweets, podcasts and other links that I have found useful to educate myself and strategically drive diversity and inclusion in tech

## Code of Conduct
Year after year in tech, I measure how important is to understand that what you could say or do could hurt someone else even unintentionally. For that, writing a Code Of Conduct and communicating with others is necessary.

## Community
I discovered WomenWhoCode when I was looking for people developing software not only on technical ways but also who valued maintaining supportive relationships in an inclusive world. And I was also looking for an organization that helps growing not only on technical way but also which relies on confidence and the ability of individuals to believe in themselves
I came from France to san Francisco to meet them during a big event WomenWhoCode organised. It was so welcoming and all the talks were full of sincerity.
